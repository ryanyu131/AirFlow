# :seedling: AirFlow+

Air quality has become a major concern. **AirFlow+** provides information people can use to take
preventative measures to keep themselves safe indoor and outdoor.

With the utilization of **IQAir API**, we have developed a tool that enables users to conveniently assess the air quality in any location of their choice without any restrictions.
